# Web3 Oracle Price Feed Engine

A professional Web3 reference project that demonstrates how decentralized oracle systems can be modeled using clean and modular blockchain architecture.

This repository focuses on simulating external data feeds, validating price integrity, detecting anomalies, and generating oracle analytics in a beginner-friendly and production-style format.

## Features

- Multi-chain RPC support  
- Oracle feed simulation engine  
- Price validation logic  
- Anomaly detection system  
- Clean console-based reporting
